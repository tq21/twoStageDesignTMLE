Description: An inverse probability of censoring weighted (IPCW) targeted maximum likelihood estimator (TMLE) for evaluating a marginal point treatment effect from data where some variables were collected on only a subset of participants using a two-stage design (or marginal mean outcome for a single arm study). A TMLE for conditional parameters defined by a marginal structural model (MSM) is also available.
